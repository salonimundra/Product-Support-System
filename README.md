# Product Support System
The project aims at developing a system which would provide after sale support to its clients. Here we are dealing with hardware support.
The idea is to make customer support system as seamless and easy as possible. This is by adding user friendly features which allows them to easily browse for help. The user has options to mail, call or chat with the technical assistant. He can also request the technicians for training sessions or arrange a visit to solve a problem through the application. 
The website would provide a hands on documentation and guide for users seeking self support. There would also be a forum where people can publicly raise their issues and get it answered from experts or people who have faced similar issues in the past.
The clients can also report bugs in the product through the application. Each time a request is made, a service id is generated. Using this service id the client can track his service status.
All these features are proposed keeping in mind smooth and easy support for the clients.<br>
The project aims to develop such an application using Software engineering techniques of Design, Analysis and Implementation.
